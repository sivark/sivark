How about a Hakyll plugin that parses a markdown list of ISBNs or Goodreads links and fetches their metadata (mainly photo?) from Goodreads or some such archive of book information.

The categorization is not rigid. And it might be possible to see links emerging, which shape my thinking.

# General physics reading

1. Feynman lectures on physics
2. A brief history of time?
3. The road to reality
4. Quantum computing since Democritus
5. Gleick, Chaos

# Math

1. Visual Complex Analysis
2. Street-fighting mathematics?
3. All the math you missed?
4. Chung, Probability?
5. Bender, videos?

# High-energy physics

1. Georgi, Weak Interactions (A treatise on effective field theory)
2. Raman Sundrum, (An introduction to AdS/CFT)

# Quantum physics and quantum information

1. Vlatko Vedral
2. Kitaev et. al.

# Statistical mechanics, information and computation

0. McKay/Sethna
1. Something on Lambda calculus and functional programming
2. Something on Kolmogrov complexity (though Gleick touches upon that)

# and nonlinear dynamics 


1. Strogatz, NLD and chaos?
2. Barabasi

----

# General

1. Guns, germs, and steel
2. Obedience to authority
3. Ignited minds, by APJ Abdul Kalam had a big impact on me when I read it, as a middle/high-school kid.
