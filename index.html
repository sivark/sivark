          <!-- <p>I am currently looking for research-oriented opportunities broadly related to machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>-->
          <p>I am currently a researcher at <a href=
          "https://www.vicarious.com">Vicarious AI</a>. I recently
          finished a Ph.D. in Physics, working with <a href=
          "https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/kilic/" target=
          "_blank">Prof. Can Kilic</a>, as part of the <a href=
          "http://zippy.ph.utexas.edu/">Theory Group</a> at
          <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas
          at Austin</a>.</p>
          <p>Before graduate school, I spent four exciting years
          (2007-2011) at the <a href=
          "https://www.iitm.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology
          Madras</a>, getting an undergraduate degree in electrical
          engineering and making wonderful friends along the
          way.</p><!-- <p>I am currently visiting the <a href="http://perimeterinstitute.ca/">Perimeter Institute</a> (in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) till December 2016, to pursue research on <a href="https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/research/research-initiatives/tensor-networks-initiative">tensor networks</a>.

        </header>
        <p align="justify">I am greatly interested in bringing
        together ideas from probabilistic inference and
        quantum/statistical physics. On the one hand, this should
        help create better algorithms for perception and decision
        making, which can be used to build autonomous agents agents
        that understand the physical world and interact with it
        more robustly. On the other hand, I believe that tools from
        probabilistic inference will help better understand
        emergent phenomena in many-body physics, such as
        holographic quantum gravity. I would love chat about my
        research or related topics; feel free to get in touch, if
        you're interested and have thoughts to share.<br>
        <br>
        I started off my PhD working in particle physics and
        cosmology. Along the way, I got really interested in the
        notion of renormalization group flow in complex systems
        with many degrees of freedom, and how this seemingly leads
        to the dynamical emergence of an <i>extra dimension</i>
        corresponding to hierarchical organization. I find it
        fascinating how ideas at the heart of renormalization group
        flow, mixed with inputs from information theory and
        computational complexity, might have deep and diverse
        applications such as statistical inference, and the
        holographic emergence of gravity from quantum
        mechanics!<br></p><!-- --

        </header>
        <p align="justify">I have been teaching a <a href=
        "https://ph.utexas.edu/current-undergraduate-students/physical-science">
        unique course</a> designed at giving students with a
        non-technical background an exposure to science and
        scientific thinking. The first segment of the course
        (PS303, which I teach) has a nominal focus on mechanics,
        but draws on examples from daily life, and emphasizes
        inquiry, to help students see how critical analysis and
        quantitative thinking can help in understanding happenings
        and making judicious decisions.</p>
        <p>One of my favourite class exercises focuses on <a href=
        "https://github.com/sivark/ExpoLab">conveying an
        understanding of exponentials</a></p>.
